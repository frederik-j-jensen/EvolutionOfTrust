BACKLOG:

SCENARIO 1:
Same as the scenario where CopyKitten is best but with one Biased group present

SCENARIO 2:
Multiple biased groups

SCENARIO 3:
AlwaysCheats within Biased.




ISSUES: 
When replicating winners and removing loosers, if there are more with the top score than needs to be removed/replicated, the order of the population becomes important. Consider to shuffle/randomize.
